# Lottery Frontend

**A simle self-resetting lottery game that takes some crypto from the joining players and a manages. The manager starts the game and randomly chooses a lottery number which in turn chooses a winner randomly and gives all the submitted cryptos as price**

*This is a simple frontend, so nothing click-clack glammy*😁
**Also, as this is a demo contract, so we assume(very boldly) that the user has the metamask installed. So this app won't be hosted, but will be referred just for some description**
